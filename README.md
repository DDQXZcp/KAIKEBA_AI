chapter3 assignment:

0. Review
In the simple linear regression code we shown in class, there are some points that you need to understand.
a. train and validation process
b. batch size
c. gradient descent 

This lesson is veryyyyyyy important! You must know everything about this class. Belows are some exercise you should accomplish.

1. Reorganize Linear Regression in Python mode. (completed)
 You have seen what we are doing in class to do linear regression. That is not bad in C++. But it's not a good
idea in Python because we were not using Python's features at all.
So, your first task is: rewrite linear regression code in Python. You are not allowed to use "Too Many For
Loops", especially when doing calculations.
Write the code in "Python's way". Go ahead and good luck.  

【optional: use matplotlib to dynamically draw animations, you may need pyplot.ion or IPython.display module】

2. Reorganize Logistic regression in Python mode.(incompleted)
Logistic regression is widely used. We derived the cost function and it's gradient in class. Please complete
the logistic regression code in "Python's way" as well.
Tips: It's almost like the linear regression code. The only difference is you need to complete a sigmoid
function and use the result of that as your "new X" and also you need to generate your own training data.
